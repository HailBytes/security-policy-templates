# Security Policy Templates

A comprehensive collection of NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) aligned security policy templates designed specifically for small to medium businesses (SMBs). These ready-to-use templates provide a structured approach to implementing essential cybersecurity policies with practical implementation guidance.

## üéØ Purpose

These policy templates help SMBs establish robust cybersecurity frameworks without the complexity typically associated with enterprise-grade security programs. Each policy is mapped to NIST CSF functions and includes practical implementation guidance tailored for resource-constrained environments.

## üìã What's Included

### Core Security Policies
- **Acceptable Use Policy** - Guidelines for appropriate IT resource usage
- **Password Protection Policy** - Comprehensive password security requirements with MFA guidance
- **Clean Desk Policy** - Physical and digital workspace security controls
- **Email Policy** - Secure email practices and threat awareness

### Incident Response & Recovery
- **Data Breach Response Policy** - Step-by-step breach response procedures with notification requirements
- **Security Response Plan Policy** - Comprehensive incident management framework
- **Disaster Recovery Plan Policy** - Business continuity and system recovery procedures

### Infrastructure Security
- **Server Security Policy** - Comprehensive server hardening and protection guidelines
- **Router and Switch Security Policy** - Network infrastructure security requirements
- **Wireless Communication Policy** - Wireless network and device security controls

### Governance & Culture
- **Ethics Policy** - Information ethics and responsible technology use
- **Implementation Guidelines** - Detailed deployment roadmap with timelines and budgets

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Assessment & Prioritization
Start with the **Implementation Guidelines** document to:
- Assess your current security posture
- Prioritize policies based on your risk profile
- Plan your implementation timeline

### 2. High Priority Policies (Weeks 1-4)
Begin with these foundational policies:
1. Password Protection Policy
2. Data Breach Response Policy  
3. Email Policy
4. Acceptable Use Policy

### 3. Customization
Replace all placeholders in the templates:
- `[Company Name]` - Your organization name
- `[Title/Role]` - Specific job titles or names
- `[Contact Info]` - Actual contact information
- `[Primary business application]` - Your critical systems

These policies comprehensively address all five NIST Cybersecurity Framework functions:

| Function | Coverage | Key Policies |
|----------|----------|--------------|
| **Identify (ID)** | Asset management, governance, risk assessment | Server Security, Ethics, Implementation Guidelines |
| **Protect (PR)** | Access control, awareness, data security | Password Protection, Clean Desk, Email, Acceptable Use |
| **Detect (DE)** | Continuous monitoring, anomaly detection | Security Response Plan, Infrastructure policies |
| **Respond (RS)** | Response planning, communications, analysis | Data Breach Response, Security Response Plan |
| **Recover (RC)** | Recovery planning, improvements | Disaster Recovery Plan, Security Response Plan |

## üíº Implementation Approach
